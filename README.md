# Pointer_Meter_Detection_and_Recognition_Dataset
Pointer Meter Detection and Recognition (PMDR) dataset, which includes datasets for meter detection, meter segmentation, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). PMDR can be used for training and testing all models in pointer meter monitoring solutions.
The lack of data sets has always been an important reason that hinders the development of pointer meter detection and recognition algorithms. For research in the field of deep learning, sufficient and high-quality data is the premise and guarantee for carrying out work. Therefore, we open source the PMDR dataset we built, which can be downloaded from here, to support the development of pointer meter detection and recognition algorithms, or other similar research.
